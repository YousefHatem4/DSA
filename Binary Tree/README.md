## Binary Tree Notes
###### A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. In C++, binary trees are often used in various applications such as searching, sorting, and maintaining a sorted stream of data.

### Basic Structure of a Binary Tree Node
##### binary tree node typically contains:
###### value (or data)
###### pointer to the left child
###### pointer to the right child

## Binary Tree Traversals
##### Traversal methods for binary trees include:
###### In-order Traversal: Left, Root, Right
###### Pre-order Traversal: Root, Left, Right
###### Post-order Traversal: Left, Right, Root
###### Level-order Traversal: Visit nodes level by level

## Height of a Binary Tree
###### The height of a binary tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf.
## Depth
###### The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.
## Level
###### The level of a node is defined as 1 plus the depth of the node.
## Sibling 
###### Nodes that share the same parent
## Full Binary Tree
###### A binary tree is full if every node has either 0 or 2 children. In other words, no node in a full binary tree has exactly one child.
## Complete Binary Tree
###### A binary tree is complete if all levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.
## Perfect Binary Tree
###### A binary tree is perfect if all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
